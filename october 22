Blob storage used for VHD

Series of VM sizes

A series Basic – for entry level
-	Only HDD
-	No load balancing
-	No auto scaling
-	

AV2
-More RAMS and CPU


D-Series
-high compute power and temp disk performance

DS and DSv2
-SSD

FS series

G Series

H
-High Performance computing

N series
-GPU accelerated Workloads

Availability Set

Fault Domain (3)
Group of resources anticipated to fail together. same rack, same server

Update Domain (4 – 20)
Group of resources that will be updated together

Available set = 99.95%                                                                                                                                                                  
Availability Zone 99.99% 
Standalone VM – 99.90%


Separate VMS to different update and fault domain


VM DISK LAYOUT
Data disk
Temporary disk (Not in cluster) 
Persistent disk

Disk caching

Cloning can be done
-Generalized method (Coming from on prem) - do sysprep. Convert VHD to image
-Specialized
-Do not put unattend.xml on the disk
-Do not install Microsoft Azure integration components
-No Microsoft Azure agent
